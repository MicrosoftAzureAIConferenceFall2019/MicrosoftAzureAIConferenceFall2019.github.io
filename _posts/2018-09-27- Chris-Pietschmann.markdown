I have nearly 20 years of experience building and architecting enterprise system, and have been focusing heavily on Microsoft Azure and the Cloud since 2010. You can follow me at http://BuildAzure.com for a weekly newsletter about Microsoft Azure, as well as other articles and guides written around Microsoft Azure technologies, certification, cloud, and Internet of Things (IoT) related topics. I have been recognized by Microsoft as being an expert in my field. My current award category is Microsoft Azure.
