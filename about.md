Artiﬁcial Intelligence is more than the hot new buzz word – it’s the future of software. Microsoft is positioned to be the key player in AI providing services through the Azure platform. The Microsoft Azure + AI Conference brings together the best and brightest from Microsoft and the broader cloud and AI industry in the late fall of 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Azure is becoming a key competitive advantage for all sizes of businesses, and your customers are keen to get onboard the cloud train. When combined with AI technologies, including vision systems, voice interaction, and machine learning and deep learning, the opportunities for growth are enormous.

As the ﬁeld of AI and cloud expands, now is the perfect time for you to announce your latest products and services. Why not make your announcements at our event where Scott Guthrie, Eric Boyd and others will be keynoting? The AI and cloud community will be looking at Las Vegas, Nevada in November 2019 – and you should be there, too.
